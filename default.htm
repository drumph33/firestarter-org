                            <p class="text-justify xs-text-center">For refugees building a new life, Houston is an extreme urban and social terrain to navigate. While it is among the largest recipients of refugee arrivals in the country, Houston offers less assistance to newly arriving families than any other major destination after the period of initial resettlement. Due to insufficient levels of support from federal and state sources, refugees are forced into rapid employment opportunities at the cost of their long-term health, education, and economic stability. However, despite being largely ignored by policymakers, available data—together with the experiences of refugees—suggests massive opportunity for investing in communities living across Houston.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify xs-text-center">Over the history of refugee resettlement in the United States, federal systems evolved to consider only a short term snapshot of employment outcomes for newly arriving refugees. Originally, the system was built with a balance between supporting the complex needs of arrivals and encouraging self-sufficiency. However, the scales were quickly tipped in favor of reducing assistance to avoid dependency. Independent of data highlighting the opportunities for investment in refugees, the modern system was built to reward reductions in assistance and to disincentivize long-term care. highlighting the opportunities for investment in refugees, the modern system was built to reward reductions in assistance and to disincentivize long-term care. <br> <br> With Texas public assistance levels below a livable threshold, the needs of the most vulnerable members of refugee communities go unmet. Single mothers, large  families and elderly are forced into models of rapid employment that were never intended for their use. As a result, both families who achieve self-sufficiency through a perpetual cycle of minimum-wage employment and families unable to fit within those narrow confines face increasingly hostile circumstances as Houstonians, as Texans, and as new Americans. <br> <br> The future of resettlement in Texas is up in the air, as new systems must be built for a long-term vision after the State’s official withdrawal in September 2016. As the number of displaced communities rises unlike any other moment in history, it is time to redefine and more effectively recreate our local and national resettlement efforts. The manner in which pathways to the American Dream are extended towards new arrivals mirrors how this country treats all of its vulnerable citizens in 21st-century America.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify xs-text-center">In the summer of 2014, as immigrants and sons of refugees, we—Yan Digilov of The Firestarter Group and Dr. Yehuda Sharim, a Kinder Institute Scholar— began to explore various ways to advance our understanding of migrant realities in Houston. We began collecting film footage of the most quotidian experiences across Houston, while building partnerships with federal agencies to map out the formal systems of resettlement. Over 700 hours of footage showing the lives of individuals from across the globe and interviews with staff from all the resettlement agencies helped paint a comprehensive picture of ongoing challenges to refugee resettlement in Houston. We also excavated genealogies of the federal program, its politics, history and development since the Refugee Act of 1980 to better understand the system. These methodological tools were used to reclaim the human realities of migration while reimaging the future of resettlement in Houston.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify xs-text-center">This report examines the U.S. refugee resettlement program and contextualizes legislation that forces employment within days of arrival at the cost of future prosperity. We explore the consequences of such a resettlement system on families who come after living in refugee camps for decades with dreams of a better life, and question the implications of a program that lacks long-term perspective. The report begins by juxtaposing public discourse on the impact of refugees with data that was available in its earliest foundations and moves on to discuss the ecosystem in Houston, Texas, which results from the rapid employment model. More specifically, we look closely into the last 37 years of government policy and explore how support for refugees plummeted over the years from an average of about $12,000 per capita in the 1980s to about $3,500 per capita in 2015, resulting in a system that places refugees into channels of cheap-labor, social isolation, political marginalization and collective silence. Immigrant voices presented here reflect realities that stem not only from a federal resettlement process but also the impact of broader American social structures. Such images and voices force you to pause and listen, paying attention to complexities, contradictions and often-muted sentiments that are echoed beyond this work. Thus, our work—though it focuses on experiences of refugees in Houston—aims to challenge greater societal tensions of economic disparity and political neglect of vulnerable communities.</p>

work are central to local, national and global discourse. It is critical to acknowledge both the limitations and utility of such categorization in any analysis describing the experiences of border crossing. The term refugee, in particular, is charged with
ephemeral and, at times, contradictory meaning</p>

                        <p>The Refugee Act of 1980 represented a massive step
forward for a country that had a longstanding, complex
relationship with immigrants. It recognized the positive
contributions of diverse immigrant groups—not only
from Europe—to American society. Rather than categorizing
all immigrants as foreigners with potentially nefarious
intentions, refugees1 were to be welcomed based on a
shared commitment to justice and moral responsibility in
the face of global catastrophe.</p>
                        
                        <p>Fast forward three decades, refugee,
as a term and an experience, has been
transformed from those who are in
need of rescue to those who could
be a potential threat to the country’s
economy and security. In one example
of such rhetoric, Texas Governor
Greg Abbott, who in the final months
of 2016 led the state’s withdrawal
from the work of refugee resettlement,
stated:</p>
            <blockquote class="border-color-deep-pink">
                            <p>“Texas has repeatedly requested that
the director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation and the director
of national intelligence provide
assurances that refugees resettled in
Texas will not pose a security threat,
and that the number of refugees
resettled in Texas would not exceed the state’s original
allocation in fiscal year 2016—both of which have been
denied by the federal government.[2]
”</p>
                            <footer>Greg Abbott</footer>
                        </blockquote>
            
            <p>In Texas, the functional consequences of Abbott’s decision
were almost unnoticeable. Refugees continued
arriving in cities across the state, while the responsibility
of allocating funding merely shifted from a state entity to
nonprofit institutions. Nonetheless, the consequences of
his rhetoric and symbolic actions run deep.6

Not only does Abbott suggest that the word refugee is 
synonymous with “threat,” but moreover, his underlying 
assumption is that all refugees are alike, they are one big 
mass, sharing very particular cultural traits, customs and 
political views.
[3]
 With the definition and experiences of 
the refugee thoroughly hijacked, Abbott moved quickly to 
pose an unanswerable question based on his own simplified depictions. How do these simplified narratives, which 
require no justification based on data or real experiences, 
come to dominate public discourse and policy?</p>
            <p>The reduction of complex refugee narratives — be it with 
the intention to save or to isolate those who “pose a security threat” — inevitably leads to a perpetuated sense of 
division between those in power and those who wait for 
permission to act. The governor is not alone in bringing 
unanimity to the experiences of a diverse community. 
Recent news articles and columns such as Bono’s “A 
Marshall Plan for Refugees” in the 
New York Times arguing that “refugees want work” so “let’s help them,”[4]
suggests that the future depends only on the observer and 
his possible actions. This discourse is cyclic and iterative 
but critical in shaping public opinion and views. The need 
to establish order through division creates a very particular state of affairs, where the underpinning assumption 
is that the observer is the one with agency and thus needs 
to provide help to those who appear to lack resources or 
will. When refugees and immigrants act without permission, they are deemed illegal, undocumented and as 
harbingers of global crisis.</p>
            <figure class="alignleft" style="max-width:40%;"><img alt="" src="images/Sept_18/def_imag_firestarter2.png"></figure>
            <p>To challenge this approach, where refugees become associated
only with “economic self-sufficiency” or as those
who have become “experts in suffering,”5
 the questions
posed by new Americans must be at the forefront. Too
much of what we think we know or don’t know depends
upon unaccountable reports that don’t go beyond the
“threat” or “needy” narratives, where the voices of immigrants
and refugees are often erased or appropriated.</p>
            <p>
            In an attempt to complicate a discourse that tends to
erase differences and essentialize refugees as a monolithic
whole, giving the impression that all of “them” arrive in
the US with the same needs and experiences, our work
centers on the personal experiences of individuals that
cannot be summarized in a news headline. Here, we
highlight three narratives that frame the conversation to
follow. First, we look at the implications of the resettlement
program’s heavy emphasis on rapid employment
and the toll it takes on recent arrivals still managing the
trauma of their past.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-color-deep-pink">“It’s hard, you know when I first came to here, because
when you come through those programs for refugees,
they have to, you have to start working because the main
goal of those programs is to get you to the way of selfsufficiency
so you can support your family. I remember
that time, not the case worker, that was kind of my
supervisor, he’s like, he told me, “We’re gonna help you
with this month, but this is gonna be your last month.
We’re not gonna help you more.” I said, “Okay. Don’t try
to put the pressure on me, because I’m already planning
on trying to work. And if you’re gonna do it this way, I
don’t want your rent. I’m better to borrow from someone
or start working than the way you tell me.” So it’s … It’s
just sometimes the attitude of the people is different. But I remember after that, I went to work
in the warehouse, even though as I
said it was hard, you know …[6]
” </blockquote>
            <p>Next, we shed light on the unique
consequences of systemic failure as
they play out in a state with extremely
limited access to public assistance:</p>
            <blockquote class="border-color-deep-pink">“Oh, thinking about next month,
how to do, I need to pay the rent. I
don’t have the money. It’s a problem.
Maybe next month, a lot of bills here,
a lot of bills coming. You don’t have
the money, how to do? You don’t have
the good job. Only the price, the food
price, coming up up up up up … Why
the people working not coming up
too? Before, this apartment about
700. I’m working 7.50 dollars, one
hour, right? Now, this apartment go high, to the 900. I’m
working for 7 dollars, 7.50. Same … see? This apartment,
the price high, why I working the same money, to pay the
money? The price high, the apartment. It’s a problem.
Why this food, right? Food, the, before, somebody only
sell about 2 dollars. Now people sell the one more, about 5
dollars. Yeah, go higher. And then, I’m working, why no
go … why the money no go high for the hour? I’m working
same place, same money. The all, all the food, all the rent,
everything that go high high high. How to do? The people
working 7.50. It’s a problem. The people, my people, big
problem. They don’t have the money. They don’t speak
English, nothing.7”</blockquote>
            <p>And lastly, we insist on highlighting the resourcefulness
and new visions that need to be promoted locally in order
to assist the most vulnerable among us:</p>
            <blockquote class="border-color-deep-pink">“When you first come to Houston, you know, you try to
explore in the area, one of the, I would say the hard thing
is you know, the transportation. We tried to use the bus,
and the bus system … I don’t think is really good here in
Houston, you know. Because I remember one of the time I
tried to use the bus, you know, and I had to wait like two
hours just for the bus to come. So, it was … That moment
I said, you know, I gotta come up with something, you
know. I ask my brother, I can borrow some money or
something, I mean, I gotta get a car for the family because
here in Houston with the bus it looks like, you know, it’s
not gonna work out. It’s just really, especially if you have
a big family, you have to take them to school, you have
doctor appointments, you know, yeah. To go to work,
you know, you don’t want to be late every day, nobody’s
gonna hire you at work if you, you know. And not all
areas the buses go, so that was one of the main challenges.
So that was when, my brother helped me buy a car for the
family, yeah. [8]
”</blockquote>
            <p>America is often regarded as “a nation of immigrants”
and the leader of the free world.<br><br>But is this statement still true today?<br><br>Like 115 millions of America’s poor, marginalized and incarcerated
African American and Hispanic communities,
handicapped people, gay and lesbian people, refugees are
not the only ones who vehemently believe in this dream
of liberty, equality and hope still woven deeply into the
fabric of this country, this democracy. The demise and
privatization of public support together with a barrage
of negative stereotypes and divisive rhetoric oppresses
America’s most vulnerable.<br><br>The 21st century American promise to treat, heal and
offer chances to the most vulnerable must be maintained,
particularly in the face of the unprecedented immigrant
and refugee catastrophe where more than 65 million
individuals are currently displaced. In a country that has
embraced, not without struggle, Henry David Thoreau’s
insistence that the role of the individual is to “do justice,
cost what it may,” it is our moral obligation to ask critical
questions about the U.S. resettlement system and then
offer visions that insist on decency, responsibility and
radical communal kindness.</p>

This narrow view— which has failed to adjust for the massive shifts in demographic composition and the complex psychological toll of migration—stems from several key assumptions about the negative impact of refugees on their new communities. To understand how those assumptions guided the program’s evolution since 1980, they must be put into the context of the data available about the long-term circumstances of refugees who arrived prior to the formation of the formal process and in the earliest years of the federal process.
</p>
            <p >Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has published annual reports to Congress, describing the circumstances of recent arrivals across the country. Statics exist starting in 1981, the first year in which ORR provided data to Congress about refugees who arrived in the US as early as 1975. These original documents are the first to suggest that, over time, refugees approach national averages for employment and labor participation. In fact, Figure 1 shows that refugees who came prior to the formation of the federal system outperform national averages after an initial period of adjustment9. While unemployment rates spiked in 1982 when U.S. labor markets were shocked by recession, refugees who had been in the country longer maintained employment near national averages. In addition, a number of economic factors showed the positive contributions of refugees across the nation.<br><br>The congressional reports delivered by ORR show that by the end of 1982, the U.S. Treasury had collected over $317 million of income tax revenue from refugee communities since the formation of the federal process.10 That sum equaled 52 percent of the average ORR annual budget for FY1980–1982. The same figures show over $3 trillion in in
come received by refugee communities, suggesting massive economic contributions to local business, as well as city and state budgets across the country. These earliest ORR figures suggest that as the numbers of refugees living in the U.S. grew over time, their net economic impact would eventually outweigh the annual cost of resettlement.<br><br>Reporting on education and health showed great potential for return on investment, as well. In the first four years of resettlement, ORR allocated an average of about $21 million to support an education transition program for primary and secondary students. Reports on this program stated, “The end-result of such programming according to State officials is that refugee children are performing in school at higher levels than anticipated.”11 Investment in health for refugee communities included funding through the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and direct costs of Medicaid. About $6.5 million dollars each year was being spent on a CDC program, which had effectively mitigated any risk of serious infection from incoming refugees. Figure 2 shows a survey from 1985 comparing Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) refugees enrolled in Medicaid to the general population across California, New York and Tennessee. Costs for refugees were on average 20 percent less than others in the program.12 While concerns were raised about the need to study health utilization among new arrivals, policymakers favored conversation about reducing assistance over making it more accessible.<br>

            <p>The early architects of federal resettlement maintained a central focus on preventing refugees from becoming dependent on public welfare. While this concern was unsupported by the data, attempts to track the outcomes of resettlement revolved entirely on measuring the 
rate of dependency for each nationality being welcomed. Inexplicably, this pursuit superseded data suggesting alternative systems would be required to deal with the complex needs of refugee communities. Large families were in need of education and training. Employable adults required English language acquisition to reclaim their productive potential. Single mothers needed childcare assistance to find work and community support to manage the emotional burdens of migration. While in the long run, refugees consistently approached national levels of employment, exceeding them when equipped with basic tools, adjustments made by policymakers focused entirely on limiting the duration and annual cost of refugee assistance.
